# ios Device Check App Attestation
A new feature with iOS 14.x in 2020.

Interesting security notes:
- The keys generated by App Attest are generated and stored inside the deviceâ€™s `Security Enclave`.
- Like other `Secure Enclave` work, the app is responsible for persisting a `key Identifier`.
- Sending the `Public Key` resists tampering by generating a hash of the public key before sending.
- It appears you can `generateAssertion` for payloads you want to tamper proof.
